These programs are related to my data structures and algorithms lecture.
I wrote two linked list programs. Linked_List.cpp is creating a linked list of items (integer) and executing functions such as delete, add, print etc. 
Linked_list_sorting.cpp is creating a linked list of students and sorting them related to their age. There are three sorting algorithms which are bubblesort, selectionsort and insertionsort.
These sorting algorithms are written according to linked list structure.
